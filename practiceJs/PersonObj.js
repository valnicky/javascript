/*Create a Person object, include Id, First, Last Name, Birthdate. Create a Student object 
that inherits from Person object and adds fields for Id, Person Id and Major. Using what 
you learned above write a program that will allow you to create a Student object with all 
data populated. (Do not worry about storing yet).

Implement a comparison method to compare two Person objects. Overload that method in 
Student to compare two Students. The overloaded method should call the parent method then
 implement additional logic.*/
