/**Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running. 
You should be using a do...while loop for this exercise.

myArray should equal [10].

i should equal 11*/

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line
while (i < 5) {
