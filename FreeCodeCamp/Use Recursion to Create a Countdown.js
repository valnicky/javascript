/**We have defined a function called countdown with one parameter (n). The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 based on the n parameter. If the function is called with a number less than 1, the function should return an empty array. For example, calling this function with n = 5 should return the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind.
 * 
 * countdown(-1) should return an empty array.
 *countdown(10) should return [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
 *countdown(5) should return [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
 * Your code should not rely on any kind of loops (for, while or higher order functions such as forEach, map, filter, and reduce).
 * You should use recursion to solve this problem.
