/*Write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns a number represents how many numbers should be added to the array to be 
consecutive array

For example

makeConsecutive([1,3,4,5]) // 1 as 2 should be added
makeConsecutive([10,12,14]) // 2 as 11 and 13 should be added
makeConsecutive([9,3,6,8])// 3 as 4,5,7 should be added*/

/*Sorted the array
Loop through the array
If the difference between element and previous element isnâ€™t 1, add that difference minus 1 to end result*/
